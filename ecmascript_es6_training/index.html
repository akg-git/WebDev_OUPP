        <h3>var</h3>
        <p>
            * scope:  global scope<br>
            [default value = undefined]
            1. declaration and initialization separately possible for var<br>
            2. re-declaration is allowed.<br>
            3. thus it provides latest updated value<br>
            4. Hoisting: returns `undefined` [ declaration is hoisted and initialized to undefined]<br>
        </p><hr>

        <h3>let</h3>
        <p>
            * scope: block level<br>
            [default value = undefined]
            1. declaration and initialization separately possible for let <br>
            2. No re-declaration<br>
            3. it provides updated value as per scope<br>
            4. Hoisting: returns `reference error` [ declaration is hoisted but not initialised]<br>

        </p><hr>

        <h3>const</h3>
        <p>
            * scope: block level<br>
            [No default value]
            1. declaration and initialization separately is not possible for const. It must be done simultaneously(in one line).<br>
            2. No re-declaration (obviously).<br>
            3. It can't be updated or modified.<br>
            4. Hoisting: returns `reference error` [ can not be accessed without initialize]
        </p><hr>

        <h3>var vs let vs const</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. </li>
            <li>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. </li>
            <li>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</li>
            <li>While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</li>
        </ul>
